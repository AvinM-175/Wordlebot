# Milestone v1.7: Dictionary Intelligence + Onboarding — Audit Report

**Audited:** 2026-02-18
**Status:** PASSED
**Milestone Goal:** Replace the brittle 30-day cache timer with content-aware dictionary change detection, and give first-time users a one-time guided introduction to the extension.

## Requirements Coverage

**Score:** 14/14 requirements satisfied

| Requirement | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|--------------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| DICT-01 | Bundle URL stored in cache | 14 | SATISFIED | provides | `[x]` | satisfied |
| DICT-02 | URL comparison on page load | 15 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |
| DICT-03 | Re-extract on URL change | 15 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |
| DICT-04 | Serve cache when URL matches | 14 | SATISFIED | provides | `[x]` | satisfied |
| DICT-05 | Background check non-blocking | 15 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |
| DICT-06 | Fingerprint mismatch re-render | 15 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |
| DICT-07 | 30-day timer fallback | 14 | SATISFIED | provides | `[x]` | satisfied |
| ONBD-01 | First-install via storage flag | 16 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |
| ONBD-02 | Distinguish install from upgrade | 16 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |
| ONBD-03 | Dismissable onboarding intro | 17 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |
| ONBD-04 | Three onboarding topics | 17 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |
| ONBD-05 | "Got it" dismissal | 17 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |
| ONBD-06 | Persistence across reloads | 17 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |
| ONBD-07 | Shadow DOM rendering | 17 | SATISFIED | listed | `[x]` | satisfied |

**Orphaned requirements:** 0
**Phase 18 (diversity refinement):** No formal requirement IDs — enhancement phase with no REQUIREMENTS.md entries. Verified by phase VERIFICATION.md (6/6 must-haves passed).

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | Status | Score | Gaps |
|-------|------|--------|-------|------|
| 14 | Dictionary Change Detection Infrastructure | passed | 5/5 | None |
| 15 | Content.js Wiring — Background Update Check | passed | 3/3 | None |
| 16 | First-Install Detection Logic | passed | 6/6 | None |
| 17 | Onboarding UI and Integration | passed | 7/7 | None |
| 18 | First-Guess Diversity Refinement | passed | 6/6 | None |

All 5 phases passed verification with zero gaps.

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Score:** 5/5 E2E flows verified

| Flow | Phases | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Dictionary URL → cache → background check → re-render | 14-15 | Connected |
| First-install detection → onboarding → dismissal → never-again | 16-17 | Connected |
| Onboarding guard — board updates don't overwrite overlay | 17 + all | Guarded |
| Background update during onboarding | 15 + 17 | Safe interaction |
| Diversity reorder isolated to opener mode | 18 | Correctly isolated |

### Notable Cross-Phase Behaviors (Correct)

- **`isOnboardingActive` timing:** Set synchronously before first render and before background check callback can fire. No race condition.
- **`clearCaches` excludes `wordlebot_onboarded`:** Shift+Refresh does not re-trigger onboarding.
- **Background update during onboarding:** Guard in `processBoardState` suppresses render; `lastSuggestions` is updated silently; user gets fresh suggestions on dismiss.
- **`saveToCache` then `clearCaches` in background update path:** By design — `checkForUpdate` logs the new fingerprint; `clearCaches` + `loadDictionaryAndCaches(true)` performs authoritative rebuild.

## Tech Debt

None accumulated across phases 14-18.

## Anti-Patterns

| Phase | Finding | Severity |
|-------|---------|----------|
| 17 | Pre-existing "Phase 7 content" comment in panelUI.js line 10 | Info (pre-existing) |

No blocker or warning anti-patterns in any v1.7 code.

## Human Verification Items

Accumulated across phase verifications — items requiring live browser testing:

### Phase 14 (3 items)
1. bundleUrl stored in chrome.storage.local after extraction
2. URL match serves cache without extraction (console log check)
3. 30-day fallback when bundleUrl manually cleared

### Phase 15 (3 items)
1. Non-blocking timing on real page load
2. Fingerprint mismatch triggers silent re-render
3. URL-change path triggers extraction

### Phase 17 (6 items)
1. Visual rendering of onboarding overlay (fresh Chrome profile)
2. "Got it" dismiss flow
3. Escape key dismiss flow
4. Persistence after reload
5. Board state update guard (typing during onboarding)
6. Dark mode visual consistency

### Phase 18 (3 items)
1. Opener diversity — visual check on empty board
2. Footer message with "chosen for letter variety"
3. Mid-game isolation — mode switch check
