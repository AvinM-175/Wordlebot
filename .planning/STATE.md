## Accumulated Context

### Decisions This Milestone
- (none yet)

### Decisions From v1.5
- Shannon entropy primary, frequency tie-breaker
- Full dictionary stats (no separate answer list)
- Shadow DOM isolation, requestIdleCallback non-blocking init
- Near-tie random sampling for openers

### Blockers/Concerns
- No automated tests (manual TEST-CHECKLIST.md only)
- 30-day dictionary cache staleness may miss NYT updates (v1.7 addresses this)
- Planning files from phases 1-11 were lost (not committed to git)
