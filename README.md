WordleBot

  A Chrome extension that coaches you through Wordle using information theory. It reads your board in real time, scores
  every possible guess by Shannon entropy, and shows you the top 5 picks with plain-English explanations — without ever
  typing a letter for you or revealing the answer.

  How It Works

  WordleBot watches the NYT Wordle board as you play. After each guess, it:

  1. Reads the board — extracts tile colors (green/yellow/gray) and letters from the DOM
  2. Filters the dictionary — narrows ~13,750 words down to only valid candidates using a two-pass constraint engine
  that correctly handles tricky duplicate letters (TEETH, EERIE, SPEED)
  3. Ranks by entropy — scores every candidate by Shannon entropy (how evenly it splits remaining possibilities across
  all 243 feedback patterns). The word that eliminates the most uncertainty wins
  4. Blends in letter frequency — breaks ties using a composite of positional frequency, overall frequency, and bigram
  patterns
  5. Adapts to urgency — early guesses favor pure information gain; as guesses run out, the engine increasingly weights
  common/likely answers so you don't waste your last guess on an obscure word
  6. Shows a floating panel — top 5 suggestions with confidence scores and expandable explanations for why each word is
  strong

  Features

  - Entropy-based ranking — mathematically optimal word selection, not just "common letters"
  - Adaptive strategy — shifts from exploration (early game) to exploitation (late game) automatically
  - Human-readable explanations — every suggestion comes with reasoning, not just a score
  - Dark/light theme — auto-matches the NYT page theme
  - Fully offline — zero network calls, no analytics, no data collection
  - No auto-submit — architecturally cannot type for you; you stay in full control
  - Fast — entropy calculations run in a Web Worker so the page never freezes; first-guess results are pre-cached

  Installation
    Option 1: Directly from Chrome Web Store:

    Option 2:
      1. Clone or download this repo
      2. Open chrome://extensions in Chrome
      3. Enable Developer mode (top-right toggle)
      4. Click Load unpacked and select the project folder
      5. Navigate to https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html and start playing — the suggestion panel appears automatically

  Design Principles

  - Assistance, not automation — teaches you to think in information theory, never plays for you
  - Privacy by architecture — no network calls, no telemetry, runs entirely in your browser
  - No solution leaks — never reveals today's answer
  - Transparency — shows why, not just what

  Tech Stack

  - Vanilla JavaScript (no build tools, no dependencies)
  - Chrome Extension Manifest V3
  - Shadow DOM for style isolation
  - Web Workers for off-thread computation
  - chrome.storage.local for caching
